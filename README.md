 ## Solubility Prediction Project
Overview:
This project focuses on predicting solubility using machine learning models based on molecular descriptors. Solubility prediction is crucial in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, chemistry, and material science.

Project Structure:
Data Loading: The Delaney solubility dataset with molecular descriptors is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Preparation: The target variable 'logS' (solubility) is extracted, and the feature matrix X is created.  
 
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

Linear Regression Model: A Linear Regression model is trained, and solubility is predicted for training and testing sets. 

Random Forest Regressor Model: A Random Forest Regressor model is trained with specified parameters, and solubility is predicted.

Evaluation: Evaluation metrics (MSE and R2) are calculated for both models to assess their performance.

Real-Time Application:
Accurate solubility prediction has practical applications in pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, and material science. It can optimize drug formulations, improve chemical processes, and aid in material design.
